# Simple ECG design
#This is a group project focused on designing a simple ECG signal acquisition circuit. The initial design used the u741 operational amplifier, and later improvements were made using the TL072 for enhanced performance.

# Flow 
• Researched and analyzed the components of a basic ECG circuit, including an instrumentation amplifier, a 4th-order low-pass Sallen-Key filter, and a twin-T notch filter using the u741 OpAmp.<br>
• Calculated appropriate component values for circuit design, simulated ECG waveforms with added noise using LTspice, and tested the circuit on a breadboard.<br>
• Designed schematic and PCB layout, and assembled the circuit on a PCB.
